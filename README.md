# EPO_Patent_Classification-Data_Science_Championship_March2024-Machinehack

AI developers‚Äô go-to platform, MachineHack, and Praxis Tech School are collectively calling upon the bright minds of engineering colleges and universities to participate in the 3rd edition of 'Data Science Student Championship'.

Marking its third consecutive year, this collaboration invites students pursuing undergraduate or postgraduate degrees from academic institutions across India to engage in the hackathon.

The two-month-long spectacle, starting on February 29, 2024, and concluding on April 25, 2024, promises the participants an exceptional platform to showcase their data science and problem analysis skills.

This data contest serves as a golden opportunity for students and academic researchers in various STEM fields to captivate the attention of premier firms. It's the stage to unveil their capabilities, innovate, and make a mark for themselves in data science.
 

üìú Eligibility Criteria

Students who wish to participate must be enrolled in the following degree programs:

BTech/ BE (All streams)
BSc/ MSc
BCA/ MCA
MTech
Participants' educational institution must be located in India. A valid student ID card from the respective college or university will be required. Participants may enter as individuals or form a dynamic duo for the challenge.
 

Round 1:

In this initial phase, participants will dive into the dataset, dissect it, and devise their solutions. Once they're confident in their work, they'll submit their solutions through the MachineHack platform.
 

Round 2:

Fast forward to April 25, 2024. The finalist, those who have risen to the top, will make their way to Bangalore. Here, they'll present their final solutions to our esteemed panel in the Final Jury Round.

**The venue of the jury round will be confirmed later**

The three presentations whose solutions shine the brightest will be crowned as the winners of the Data Science Student Championship 2024, earning themselves the honor of being the champions and cash awards.

But every finalist is a winner here. All of our top 6 individuals will receive certificates of commendation, a salute to their exceptional work and dedication in the field of data science. üèÜüéìüìà
 

üéØ Judging Criteria

In the final jury round, the winner will be determined based on:

30% Statistical and ML Algorithm
30% Innovation and Creativity
20% Business Outcome or Impact
20% Presentation and Communication Skills
 
üìå Additional Information

Here are some key details about the final jury round for the top presentations:

We'll provide round-trip bus or train tickets from the nearest metro city to your residence. However, please note that meals during the journey are not included, and you'll need to cover those expenses.
